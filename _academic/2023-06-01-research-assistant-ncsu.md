excerpt: built large-scale pipelines for fuzzing WebAssembly runtimes, including Wasmer, Wasmtime, WAMR, and WasmEdge. Designed automated systems for crash discovery, seed categorization, and logging, which led to uncovering more than 30 bugs and contributing patches upstream. Additionally, developed differential testing workflows to identify runtime inconsistencies and integrated the findings into open-source projects, improving the reliability and robustness of WebAssembly runtimes.
