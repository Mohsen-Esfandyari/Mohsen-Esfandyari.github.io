excerpt: Beginner C project that reads network traffic (HTTP, DNS) and suggests simple firewall rules.
tags: [c, networking, libpcap, http, dns, firewall]
---

Engineered a firewall in C using libpcap, parsing Ethernet, IPv4, TCP/UDP, DNS, and HTTP traffic at the packet level. Implemented rule-based filtering to allow or block connections based on domain names and CIDR ranges, while handling protocol headers and payload inspection. Built comprehensive logging and reporting to capture HTTP requests, DNS queries, and blocked traffic, with automated generation of firewall rules for operational integration.
